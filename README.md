# IMPROVING MULTIPLE STRESSOR-RESPONSE MODELS THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF NONLINEARITY AND INTERACTIONS

## Background

This project aimed to incorporate both nonlinearity and interactions into a multivariate stressor response model in order to examine whether any improvements can be made to the accuracy of predictions. Two EPA datasets were used in this analysis: a national macroinvertebrate dataset collected for the biomonitoring of Ireland's river network, 2007 - 2018 (Feeley, H.B. *et al*, 2020); and a phytobenthic dataset collected for the Water Framework Directive Monitoring Programme of Ireland's river network, 2016-2018. 

## Objectives

1. Does nonlinearity improve models?
2. Do interactions improve models?
3. What stressors are important when monitoring water quality?
